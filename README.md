A project to detect malwares written in Javascript using machine learning approach!  
AUTHOR: [easa](https://github.com/easa)

contains 4 repository
1. The feature extractor
2. The model maker
3. The browser (chrome) extension 
4. The webpage [this project]

‍‍‍‍× The browser extention uses both 1 and 2 to detect and prevent js malwares from loading.


In this project I used a free theme (it's hard to customize, but it's ok. I like the dark of it)
